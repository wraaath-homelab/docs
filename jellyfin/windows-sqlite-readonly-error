# Windows SQLite ReadOnly Error

If you, like me, are using Jellyfin on Windows, and get the error `SQLite Error 8: 'attempt to write a readonly database'.` from the logs, then this should help you.

1. Head over to the `Server`-folder.

Go to the path `C:\ProgramData\Jellyfin\Server` in your File Explorer.

2. Give your Windows user permissions on the `data`-folder.

Right click "data" -> `Properties` -> `Security` -> Click on your user (eg. `wraaath DESKTOP-blahblah`) -> `Edit` -> Allow "Full control"

3. Change database files

Now Windows might say it couldn't give the permissions to a couple database files.
If that is the case, just navigate over to the files and individually give them the same permissions as previously done.
